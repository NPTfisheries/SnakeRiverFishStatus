  # From Baum et al. 2022: Trapped fish that were missing data for any of the following fields were considered invalid: date
  # of collection, species, FL, origin (hatchery or wild), or adipose fish status (ad-clipped or ad-intact). Trapped fish less
  # than 30 cm (FL) were considered invalid as they are not identified to species at the USACE fish-counting window
